        "### t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE)\n",
        "t-SNE is a very complex technique, which can often yield truly stunning results when reducing high-dimensional datasets. Here is a pretty good explanation of t-SNE from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding):   \n",
        "> \"The t-SNE algorithm comprises two main stages. First, t-SNE constructs a probability distribution over pairs of high-dimensional objects in such a way that similar objects have a high probability of being picked, whilst dissimilar points have an extremely small probability of being picked. Second, t-SNE defines a similar probability distribution over the points in the low-dimensional map, and it minimises the [Kullback–Leibler divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence) between the two distributions with respect to the locations of the points in the map. Note that whilst the original algorithm uses the Euclidean distance between objects as the base of its similarity metric, this should be changed as appropriate.\"   \n",

Now, assume we have 10 million documents and the word \"cat\" appears in one thousand of these. Then, the inverse document frequency (i.e. idf) is calculated as ln(10,000,000 / 1,000) = 4.

These concepts were demonstrated using two different datasets: one of images and another of text. You have seen how using these can be effective in reducing the dimensions and thus the computational complexity when working with various forms of data. Now it is up to you to experiment with the above example to gain a further understanding of dimensionality reduction techniques and their uses.\n",
