        "A widely encountered problem in machine learning is that of dimensionality. We typically refer to the size or shape of a dataset as an $n$ x $p$ matrix, where each row from 1 to $n$ represents an observation or data point, and each column from 1 to $p$ represents a variable or feature. With each additional feature, the dimensionality of a dataset increases by 1.\n",

        "\n",
        "- More storage space required for the data;\n",
        "- More computation time required to work with the data; and\n",
        "- More features mean more chance of feature correlation, and hence feature redundancy.\n",
        "\n",
        "The latter point is the basis on which **principal component analysis** is carried out. A feature that is highly correlated with another increases when the other increases (positive correlation) or decreases when the other increases (negative correlation). This is helpful because if multiple features tend to behave in a corresponding manner in the dataset, they can often be replaced by some smaller number of representative feature(s). This helps to lower the feature space within which the data reside, reducing computation time as well as storage capacity requirements.\n",
